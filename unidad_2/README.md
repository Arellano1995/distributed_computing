Introduction
Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel programming where multiple processes can be executed at the same time. Asynchronous programming has been growing thanks to its advantages, mainly being efficiency and speed.

When using threads for the realization of an asynchronous system allows us to assign threads to different processes and to better use the time of use of the processor, it is important to mark the closing of the thread at the end of its task.
