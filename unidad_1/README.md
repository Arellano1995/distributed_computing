#Summary of the videos

#1st video https://youtu.be/7VbL89mKK3M
The first video is an introduction to distributed computing, it gives us the definition of distributed computing and its advantages,
and the difference between centralized and distributed.
Pros of centralized computing:
Because it's just one computer it's easy to use and therefore fast.
Pros of distribuited computing:
-Can support many user(computers)
-Tolerate failures

10 reasons to use a distributed system.
-At the request of the boss.
-It's fun, because it makes work easier.
-It is necessary to be able to access information where, when necessary, it is no longer a luxury.
-For legal, privacy and political reasons, sometimes you must have a backup of the information, or avoid being within the reach of a physical team, which is easily vulnerable.
-For times of activity, the server will always be active even if the offices are not open.

How to learn distributed systems?
It is important to understand that distributed systems are an experimental science and not just something theoretical.That is why current distributed systems are born and from debugging and modifying systems and modifications.

Systems fail! That is why our system must have fault tolerance.

One of the great challenges in distributed computing is to get computers to communicate with each other correctly. for which two models have been developed, the shared memory model and the message passing model.
